## Methodological Projects

You need to select one area to focus on. Keep in mind that it may be a subject that you are not familiar with. Your initial task is to study the topic and show how to utilize the new approach on an actual dataset. The result of the project will include a written report and a presentation slide.

The methodologies to consider:

- Missing Data and Imputation
- Long Short-Term Network
- Quantile Regression
- Generalized Additive Models
- Normal Linear Mixed Models
- LASSO and Ridge Regression
- Cross-validation
- Bootstrapping and Jackknife Estimation
- Kernel Regression
- K-means clustering
- Principal Component Analysis
- Generalized estimating equations
- Cox proportional hazards model
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest
- Bayesian Networks
- Latent Class Analysis
- etc.


You are free to propose a **topic** if there is something you are interested in but is missing from the list.  The instructor must approve the methodology to ensure that it meets the expectations of a capstone project.
